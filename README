A simple secure password manager

DESCRIPTION:

This program maintains a secure database of passwords to
a collection of sites.  The intended (but not required)
usage is to generate secure passwords from one "master password".

The method is to create an iterated sha512 hash of the 
"master password", salted with the user@hostname string.  
This hash is then encoded in a selectable alphabet and 
truncated to any desired length.  These features should
allow passwords to be created to match even the most 
restrictive policies.

The password will be copied to the GTK clipboard if 
available, or else printed to stdout.  Note: You have to 
right-click "paste" -- middle mouse button does not work
with this.

The database itself stores only the user@hostname, the number
of iterations used in hashing, the alphabet, the length of 
the password, and a "verification" hash (using an alternate salt).
The verification hash is used to ensure that the correct 
master password has been provided for retrieval requests.

Note: There is no need to use the same master password for all
sites, although allowing this is a design goal of this project.

The master and generated passwords are not stored anywhere,
and should be secure in the event that a single generated 
password or the password database is compromised.  This is,
of course, contingent upon a reasonably strong choice of
master password.

The generated passwords are a deterministic function of the 
master password, the number of iterations ("difficulty"), the
alphabet, password length, and the user/host name.  Thus,
if default parameters are used, the database is not strictly
necessary.

EXAMPLES:

- Create a strong password
  ./passwords.py create -u user@host

- Create a strong password with a memo
  ./passwords.py create -u user@host -m 'Important account!'

- Create a password of length 8 using only alphanumeric chars
  ./passwords.py create -u user@stupidhost -l 8 -a nosymb

- Retrieve a password
  ./passwords.py get -u user@host

- List passwords in database
  ./passwords.py list

- Delete password from database
  ./passwords.py delete -u user@host
